This number guessing game is an easy project built on Java where 
the player has to guess a number given in between a range.
If the guessed number is right, the player wins else, loses. It
also has the concept of limited attempts where the player has to 
guess the number within the limited attempts given.

## Abstract:

The UI has an input value option where the player has to enter the
guessed value, it also displays the time remaining to guess. After
completing the limits given, if the guessed number is right, the player
wins else loses. The range between the number can be from 1 to 100 or 
1 to 1000. Also, if the number you’ve guessed is high or low to the 
actual value, the application sends you an alert “Too High” or “Too Low”.
After the limited attempt is completed, the actual value is revealed.
